The Rocket League Replay Handler is an application for the purpose of making it easier to keep track of you rocket league replay.
This project is still in very early development and not suitable for use yet.

Planned features

* Add timestamped tags to a replay to make it easier to remember when a cool event happened.
* Group replays together.
* Searching among replays on different parameters (eg. playernames, scores, tags, groups etc.)
* Detection of new files to ease the process of incorporating it into the application.
* Custom loading/deloaing to eliminate need to scroll through all replays in the RL replaymenu.
* Possibly ability to have certain parameters preloaded by parsing the replay.
* Upload/download replays from rocketleaguereplays
* Exporting/Importing one or several replays together with all their added tags etc.
